# UI redesign and verification report

Version 6.0 extends the professional textbook / institutional research manual with a reviewed Wyckoff 2.0 curriculum covering auction theory, volume profile and order flow.

## Design system changes

- Replaced the 276 px permanent reader sidebar with a 54 px page-edge rail and a keyboard-accessible three-view index drawer.
- Rebuilt login, course, phase and chapter openings on one editorial grid; removed presentation-style full-screen color fields and oversized decorative numerals.
- Standardized chapter content into narrative, evidence and research/checklist structures without keyword-driven layout selection.
- Kept one deep blue as the primary editorial accent. All phase colors now share the same reading surface and contrast system.
- Added chapter-opening drop caps, evidence plate captions, mobile table guidance, figure pan/zoom, restrained ink-transition motion and reduced-motion support.
- Moved the chapter body higher in the first viewport and removed the misleading four-item “Learning Path”. The complete structure now lives in the chapter index.

## Interaction and accessibility

- Drawer focus return, focus containment, Escape close, `inert`, `aria-expanded` and tab semantics.
- Search loading, failure, empty and result-count states; debounced queries and safe term highlighting.
- Figure viewer supports 75–300% zoom and panning for ultra-wide charts.
- Mobile tables expose a scroll hint and sticky row labels.
- Demo login uses POST markup plus a local UI redirect; credentials are never placed in the URL or stored.
- Paper/muted text contrast: 4.95:1. Primary blue/paper contrast: 6.70:1.

## Course coverage

- 7 phases and 30 chapter routes
- 1,202 chapter paragraphs
- 401 chapter headings
- 74 lists
- 33 course figures
- 29 research tables
- 2,026 searchable records with verified anchors

## Automated gates

- Astro diagnostics: 0 errors, 0 warnings
- 40 static routes built
- HTML validation: 0 errors
- Content, figure and search-anchor audit: passed
- Duplicate ID, internal link and internal anchor audit: passed
- Unsafe GET password-form audit: passed
- Clean-build step removes stale hashed assets before every production build

The included `npm run visual` task covers 15 representative desktop, tablet and mobile states. Headless Chromium execution is restricted in the managed build container, so screenshot generation should be rerun in a normal local or CI environment before release approval.

## Runtime boundaries

- Login is a front-end prototype, not a security boundary.
- Reading progress and font scale are stored locally in the browser.
- The output remains a static Astro site suitable for Cloudflare Pages.
